# laravel-static-blogger
A laravel content creator that creates static files from database-driven content

# What is this for?
This project allows a tech-savvy author to host simple articles or blog posts without the overhead of a hosted blog. Using a very simple UI, this allows a user to create one or more articles. These are converted to static files (complete with headers, footers, auto-generated links, images, and content) and uploaded to Amazon's S3.

Additionally, the app generates a simple "index" for articles that allows search engines or users to browse. 

# Why?
This isn't a robust, full-featured system, but it allows someone to host basic content for very little money (and without the overhead, security flaws, and annoyance of spinning up Wordpress or other platforms). 

Also, this application is meant to be a demonstration of my skills as a LAMP developer, specifically for the laravel platform.
